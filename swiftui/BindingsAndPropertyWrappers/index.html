Its strong typing system and error handling prevents runtime code crashes and other errors in production. By giving the compiler such a central role in enforcing consistency up front, Swift has a shorter feedback loop. This means that many errors in the code are caught up front, giving you the opportunity to fix them before you even try to run the code, greatly reducing the time and effort needed for bug fixing and reducing the risks of deploying low quality code.<br><br>I could spend pages describing why I think <code>SwiftUI</code> is where your time is best spent.

It may seem strange to you that I spend so much time on these two topics, and then rarely mention them in the other chapters.

A more complete discussion of property wrappers requires a discussion of the <code>Combine</code> framework.

You can create your own bindings with the <code>@Binding</code> property wrapper, and pass bindings into views that require them. Or you can use a property wrapper, like <code>@State</code>, which exposes a binding to its wrapped value.

   init((shouldDisplayText: Binding<Bool>) {
      _shouldDisplayText = shouldPrint
   }
   ...
   shouldDisplayText = true
   ...
}
```

Working with the above code, here are a few observations:  
- `shouldDisplayText` is defined by the parent view.  
- because it is a `@State` variable, it is owned by this (parent) view  
- this bears repeating: `@State` has special properties that allow its wrapped value to remain intact when the view is recreated (typically due to a mutation or update to some property)  
- `$shouldDisplayText` is a binding to the wrapped value (in this code it is false until set to true in the child view)  
- The wrapped value can be accessed using a leading underscore: `_shouldDisplayText`, or via its `.wrappedValue` property.  
- Since a binding is passed to the child view's initializer, `SomeOtherView` can change the value from true to false  
- The parent view can respond to changes in the `shouldDisplayText` value made by the child view.  

So far I've glossed over the definition of what makes a property wrapper, but now that you've seen how it's declared and used, the following information has a better chance of `sticking`.

## Property Wrappers  

When I first looked up property wrappers, this is what I found:  

>[Property wrappers] Allow you to extract common logic in a distinct wrapper object  

I hate circular definitions.  This doesn't explain anything to me.  

>A property wrapper can be seen as an extra layer that defines how a property is stored or computed on reading. It’s especially useful for replacing repetitive code found in getters and setters of properties.  

At least this tells me why I might want to consider using one.  

A property wrapper is a generic structure that encapsulates read and write access to the property and adds additional behavior to it. We use it if we need to constrain the available property values, add extra logic to the read/write access (like using databases or user defaults), or add some additional methods.  

This is maybe a bit more than we need right now. I will defer discussion of the role of generics for a different day.  

>Although it would be convenient to think that everything that starts with an `@` is a property, this just isn’t the case. Keywords starting with an @ are instructions to the compiler, and signaling a property wrapper is just one of its uses.  

I'm going to close out this discussion with a brief summary of some very common SwiftUI property wrappers.  

## `@State`  

State is the simplest source of truth your app can have. It is designed to contain simple value types, such as Ints, Strings, and Bools. It is not designed for more complex, reference types, such as any classes or structs you define yourself and use within your app.  

>Whenever a `@State` variable is updated, the view itself is refreshed/recreated to reflect the new value.  

#### @State  

`@State` - this wrapper declares local value property. Apple recommends that you mark `@State` variables  private, because the view manages its lifetime locally.  

>[David Pasztor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61361788/state-vs-observableobject-which-and-when) If you mark any variables as @State in a SwiftUI View and bind them to a property inside the body of that View, the body will be recalculated whenever the @State variable changes and hence your whole View will be redrawn. Also, @State variables should serve as the single source of truth for a View. For these reasons, @State variables should only be accessed and updated from within the body of a View and hence should be declared private.  

### `@StateObject`  

 a `@StateObject` is also designed to be the owner of the data. You initialize it right there and thus you know exactly where it comes from.  
 
 ## `@StateObject`  

>A property wrapper type that instantiates an observable object (which is a type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed)  

SwiftUI’s @StateObject property wrapper is a specialized form of @ObservedObject, having all the same functionality with one important addition: it should be used to create observed objects, rather than just store one that was passed in externally.  

When you add a property to a view using @StateObject, SwiftUI considers that view to be the owner of the observable object. All other views where you pass that object should use @ObservedObject.  


By using @StateObject, we are letting our view know that whenever any of the @Published properties within the Observable Object change, we want the view to re-render - we are now listening for changes to any of its marked @Published properties.  

>A thorough explanation of `@Published` would neccesitate covering the `Combine` framework. This needs to be left for another day - please open an issue if you'd rather see it appear sooner than later.  

SwiftUI’s @StateObject property wrapper is designed to fill a very specific gap in state management: when you need to create a reference type inside one of your views and make sure it stays alive for use in that view and others you share it with.  
 
You should use @StateObject only once per object, which should be in whichever view is responsible for creating the object. All other views that share your object should use @ObservedObject.  

>[David Pasztor] If you mark any variables as @State in a SwiftUI View and bind them to a property inside the body of that View, the body will be recalculated whenever the @State variable changes and hence your whole View will be redrawn. Also, @State variables should serve as the single source of truth for a View. For these reasons, @State variables should only be accessed and updated from within the body of a View and hence should be declared private.  

### When to use either of these two  

You should use @State when you are binding some user input (such as the value of a TextField or the chosen value from a Picker). @State should be used for value types (structs and enums).  

On the other hand, @ObservedObject should be used for reference types (classes), since they trigger refreshing a view whenever any @Published property of the ObservableObject changes.  

You should use @ObservedObject when you have some data coming in from outside your View, such as in an MVVM architecture with SwiftUI, your ViewModel should be stored as an @ObservedObject on your View.  
 
## The `ObservableObject` Protocol  

This protocol is defined in `Combine`, and it defines a type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed. This effectively means that when @Published properties in an `ObservableObject` change, your view is notified of the change so it can respond to the change.  

`ObservableObjects` change the @Published property when a final value is ready. Conversely any changes you make to the properties of a `View` struct are immediately reflected, causing the view to be rendered anew immediately. This is part of the "push-pull" dichotomy of struct vs. class (value vs. reference types)  


## `@ObservedObject`  

A property wrapper type that subscribes to an observable object and invalidates a view whenever the `ObservableObject` changes. In contrast to the earlier wrappers, `@ObservedObject` is used to keep track of an object that has already been created.  

I have left out many useful property wrappers in this discussion, but I have covered enough of the groundwork for you to start to make your own connections when you see a property wrapper defined or used. And you will see them frequently.
